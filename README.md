# M117App
Project Order Food

An app made for our M117 class. Though it was for a class, it was completely student done with absolutely no guidance, just requirements, which were to include some form of wireless communication.

I worked on the Android part of this (web) app.

The backend/server-side code is not uploaded but it was created using Google App Engine and written in Python for the most part. This was done by two of my partners.
